## Dveloper Test

### Overview

The Developer Test is a simple test we give our prospective web developers to see how they do given a coding task.

The premise is simple, create a PHP script that performs a search on Twitter using the Twitter Search API for tweets containing any of the following words: red, green, blue or yellow.

The output should be a HTML page that displays the tweet data (author, avatar, tweet body, created date) on a page. Also, extract the first matching word from the tweet body, and show it somewhere on the tweet (maybe as the background colour).

* The PHP can either be above the HTML or inline, but should be properly indented and easy to read.
* The layout needs to be clean and well styled.
* Your CSS can be either internal or external.
* Your HTML and CSS should pass W3 validation.
